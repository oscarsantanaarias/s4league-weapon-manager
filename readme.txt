Hello, my name is Oscar Santana I have created this tool to help the community.

The only requirement is node.js installation.

In Item Manager.bat you can change the location if you don't want to be opening CMD each time.
Here is the current location: cd /d C:\ItemManager change it to whatever is your  ItemManager folder location.

I will be updating the software often.

This software  ask you if you want to use DB if not it will only write in the files X7 and XML, you can click on Manage DB to enter your db information + tables shop_items and shop_iteminfos if you have it with a different name. I am the only developer but any bugs or suggestions are appreciated, so far I didn't find any bug and I covered all possible bugs.

Extract the rar resources, it includes the resources files such as folders required and X7/XML files empty for test + 1 item to quick test how it works, the node_modules too which is heavy and as it is Github doesn't allow to be uploaded so I made it a rar to make things simple and easy.
